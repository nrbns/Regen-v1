# 🎯 Regen Positioning & Demo Script

**Goal**: Shift perception from "browser feature" → "private AI operating system"

---

## 🎬 The Story (2 Minutes)

### Old Narrative ❌
> "It's a browser with AI. You can search, trade, and research."

**Problem**: Sounds like Chrome + ChatGPT = Nothing new.

### New Narrative ✅
> **"Regen is a private intelligence OS that works even without the internet."**
> 
> You have control. Your data never leaves your device. And it actually understands what you're trying to do.

**Why this works**: 
- Positions vs Comet/Genspark → "**Privacy first**"
- Positions vs Chrome → "**Your data, your rules**"
- Positions vs ChatGPT → "**Works offline**"
