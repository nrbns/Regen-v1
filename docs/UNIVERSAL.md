# Regen — Universal Application Description

Regen is a local-first AI execution environment designed for low-resource devices and long, stable sessions.

Unlike cloud AI tools, Regen runs primarily on the user’s device, works offline after setup, and enforces strict system-level resource limits. AI execution is governed by memory, CPU, and battery conditions, with automatic recovery from failures.

The browser is used as the initial interface, but the long-term goal is a personal AI execution layer that prioritizes trust, efficiency, and transparency over features or scale.

Regen is currently in early access, focused on system stability, observability, and disciplined execution.

Use this description for incubators, grants, and partner materials where a concise, trust-focused summary is needed.
