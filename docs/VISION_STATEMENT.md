## What We're Building

### Not Just a Browser

OmniBrowser is **not**:

- ❌ Another Chrome copy
- ❌ Another AI sidebar
- ❌ Another Perplexity clone
- ❌ Another privacy browser

OmniBrowser **is**:

- ✅ The first **AGENTIC browser** - AI drives the browser
- ✅ The first **voice-driven multilingual browser** - 12 languages
- ✅ The first **automation-native browser** - built-in, not plugin
- ✅ The first **India-first privacy browser** - data sovereignty
- ✅ The **end-game evolution** of browsing

## The 5 Pillars

### 1. Chrome-Level Browsing

Users forget they're not using Chrome. Fast, stable, familiar.

### 2. Atlas/Comet Automation

Browser drives itself. Automation is native, not a plugin.

Research inside the browser, not external. Can open pages, analyze, automate.

### 4. Brave Privacy

India-first privacy. No US servers, no tracking, data sovereignty.

### 5. Made-in-India

12 languages, voice trading, government automation. Features NO ONE can copy.
