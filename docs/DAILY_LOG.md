# Daily Dogfooding Log

Track daily usage of Regen Browser as primary browser for 7 days.

## Guidelines

**MUST DO:**

- Use Regen as primary browser for ALL browsing
- Test for 15-20 minutes MINIMUM per day
- Test real-world sites (Google, YouTube, Gmail, GitHub, TradingView)
- Log every bug, crash, or unexpected behavior
- Rate stability daily (1-10)

**MUST NOT DO:**

- Wire APIs or automation (wait until 7 clean days)
- Add new features during dogfooding period
- Skip days (restarts 7-day counter)
- Use workarounds (if something breaks, log it and fix it)
