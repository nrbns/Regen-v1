Regen-v1 Roadmap
=================

Future: Network isolation / routing layer

Notes:
- v1 intentionally omits integrated VPN/Tor/network routing features.
- These features are planned for a future release focused on network isolation.
# ROADMAP — short-term priorities

This file documents features intentionally deferred from v1.

Deferred: Network & VPN

- VPN / system-level routing / network isolation: deferred from v1 due to complexity, liability, and maintenance.
- For v1 we will not ship any VPN UI or claims. Consider adding: "Future: Network isolation / routing layer" to the product roadmap.

Voice (Whispr)

- Whispr will be available as a manual input (press-to-talk) in v1. Always-on listening and wake-word services are deferred.

Other deferrals

- Accounts, sync, and marketplaces are out of scope for v1.
- Extensions and background agents are deferred unless they improve stability or repair.

These decisions aim to keep v1 small, stable, and trustworthy.
