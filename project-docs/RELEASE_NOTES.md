# Regen v1 — Early Access / Technical Preview

Release: Regen v1 — Early Access / Technical Preview

Summary

Regen is a privacy-first, low-resource AI-enabled browser designed for long, focused sessions. It manages intent, system resources, and recovery from failures automatically while running locally by default.

Key points

- Local-first by default; network features are explicit and opt-in.
- Designed for low resource usage and long sessions.
- Visible system status (memory, uptime, redix health) and a clear privacy indicator.
- Minimal first-run: no account, no forced tour, AI features only when asked.

Notes for reviewers

- This is an Early Access / Technical Preview: stable core features are ready, but the product remains under active development.
- Avoid hyperbolic language in public-facing copy — emphasize stability, privacy, and local-first design.
