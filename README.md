# Regen Browser

A calm, local-first browser with optional AI assistance.

Regen is a **privacy-respecting desktop browser** designed to feel fast, quiet, and trustworthy — with AI that stays out of your way unless you explicitly ask.

This is **v1 (Early Access)**. The focus is on browser stability, usability, and a clean foundation for future AI OS capabilities.

## Why Regen?

Most modern browsers are:
- noisy
- cloud-dependent
- extension-heavy
- increasingly intrusive

Regen is built differently.

- 🧘 Calm, minimal interface
- 🔒 Local-first by design
- 📴 Works offline (with local models)
- 🤖 AI assistance is optional, not forced
- 🚀 Focused on performance & stability

Regen does **not** try to replace your workflow.
It tries to **stay out of the way**.

---

## What Regen v1 Is

- A real, usable desktop browser
- Multi-tab browsing
- Familiar navigation (back / forward / reload)
- Working downloads
- Session continuity
- Optional local AI assistance
- Honest, minimal UI

---

## What Regen v1 Is NOT (Yet)

- ❌ Not an AI OS
- ❌ Not a self-healing system
- ❌ Not a resource-governing runtime
- ❌ Not a Chrome replacement (yet)
- ❌ Not autonomous or agent-driven

Those are **future goals**, not current claims.

---

## AI Philosophy

Regen treats AI as a **tool**, not a controller.

- AI never runs automatically
- AI never interrupts browsing
- AI only responds when you ask
- AI runs locally when possible
- Browser works fully even if AI is unavailable

If AI fails, **the browser continues normally**.

---

## Offline & Privacy

- No mandatory accounts
- No forced sync
- No background tracking
- Local models supported (via Ollama or similar)
- Network use is explicit and user-driven

Your browsing remains **your business**.

---

## Status

**Version:** v1 (Early Access)
**Focus:** Browser stability, UX calmness, local-first foundation
**Stage:** Actively improving core browsing + AI assistance

---

## Roadmap (High Level)

- v1.x → Stability, performance, UX polish
- v2 → Resource awareness, better AI lifecycle
- v3 → True AI OS capabilities (Redix-like control, repair, policies)

No timelines promised.
Features ship only when they are real.

## Philosophy

> "A browser should feel boring when it works —
> and invisible when it helps."

That is Regen's goal.
